<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

we build a tiny core set of scikit-learn from scratch for educational
purposes.

the only dependency is numpy (so far).

## Install

clone this repo and

``` bash
pip install -e .
```

`-e` for editable mode.

## How to use

``` python
from min_sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np
```

``` python
x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
y = np.array([0, 1, 2, 5])
assert accuracy_score(x,y, normalize=True, weights = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0])) == 1.0
```
